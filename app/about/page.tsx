                    <p>My name is Marcondes, I'm 30 years old and I've been a web developer for 5 years.

                    <p>I've worked with React and TypeScript, ventured into ASP.NET and WordPress, and built layouts with Styled-components. Currently, I'm involved with the amazing Tailwind and Next. I always adopt the best practices and tools in the market to deliver high-quality products.</p>
